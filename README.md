## Game Overview

in Hex Zero, players place multi-hex shapes onto a hexagonal board. Each hex on the board displays a "height" number indicating how many pieces must be placed covering that hex. When a septomino is placed, it decreases the height of all covered hexes by 1. Players win when all hexes on the board reach height 0.

## Game Mechanics and Structure

### Septomino Pieces

Septominoes are puzzle pieces containing:

- Exactly one center hexagon
- 2 to 6 neighboring hexes directly adjacent to the center
- Total of 3 to 7 tiles per piece
- All tiles must be within the immediate neighborhood of the center hex (no long lines)

### Level Generation

Levels are procedurally generated to ensure solvability:

1. Start with all hexes at height 0
2. Generate a number of septomino pieces based on difficulty
3. Randomly place the generated pieces to build up heights
4. Present those exact pieces to the player to solve

### Gameplay Features

- Players can cycle through septomino pieces and place them in any order
- Septominoes cannot be rotated - pieces maintain fixed orientations
- Players can request a hint, which shows where the current piece was placed during level generation
- Undo/redo functionality
- Restart puzzle
- Instructions screen
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Victory screen with:
    - Difficulty level
    - Number of undos used
    - Number of hints used
    - Confetti

### Difficulty Levels

- **Easy**: Radius 3 board with 4 pieces
- **Medium**: Radius 3 board with 6 pieces (recommended)
- **Hard**: Radius 3 board with 8 pieces
- **Extreme**: Radius 4 board with 10 pieces
- **Impossible**: Radius 4 board with 14 pieces
- **Custom**: User-configurable radius (2-8) and number of pieces

## Technical Details

### Board Layout

The game board consists of a hexagonal grid arranged in a pointy-topped orientation. Each individual hex tile is drawn flat-topped.

### Controls

- Placed pieces are removed from the cycle, but pieces are still labeled with their original piece number
- The restart option behaves as if undo were pressed for every move, populating the redo stack

#### Desktop Controls

- **Arrow keys**: ↑/↓ cycle pieces, ←/→ undo/redo
- **Mouse wheel**: Cycle through remaining pieces
- **Mouse**: Hover to preview, click to place, drag to pan
- **Zoom**: +/- keys to zoom in/out
- **Keyboard shortcuts**:
    - H: Show hint
    - R: Reset view (zoom and pan)
    - I: Show instructions
    - ?: Show keyboard shortcuts
- **Buttons**: Show Hint, New Game, Restart Level

#### Mobile Controls

- Touch: Preview piece placement and place pieces
- **Pinch to zoom** in/out for better visibility
- **Two-finger pan** to move around the board
- **Bottom control bar** with: Prev, Hint, Next, Undo, Reset, Redo

#### Hover/Preview System

- **Valid placement** (all covered hexes have height > 0):
    - Shows preview of board state after placement
- **Invalid placement**:
    - Pieces can only be placed where all covered hexes have height greater than 0.

### Responsive Design

- Canvas automatically scales to fit screen while maintaining board visibility
- Hex size adjusts based on both canvas size and board radius
- Mobile layout optimizes for touch interaction and screen space

## Development

The game is built with TypeScript and Vite, requiring Node.js to run locally.

### Architecture

The codebase has been refactored into a modular architecture for maintainability:

- **Game State Management** (`src/state/`):
    - `GameState.ts`: Core game logic and state management
    - `HexGrid.ts`: Hexagonal grid representation and coordinate system
    - `SeptominoGenerator.ts`: Procedural piece generation
- **Rendering** (`src/renderer/`):
    - `HexRenderer.ts`: Coordinate conversion and rendering utilities
- **Canvas Management** (`src/canvas/`):
    - `CanvasManager.ts`: Canvas operations and drawing utilities
- **UI Components** (`src/ui/`):
    - `ColorTheme.ts`: Color constants and theming
    - `InputValidator.ts`: Form validation logic
- **Comprehensive test suite** with Vitest for game logic validation

### Prerequisites

This project uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to manage development tools.

### Setup

To run the game locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/motlin/hex-zero.git
cd hex-zero

# Install mise if you haven't already
# See https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html for installation instructions

# Install the required tools
mise install

# Install npm dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
just dev

# Run tests
